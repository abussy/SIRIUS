This is a very early test version of the SIRIUS Julia API. TO get it working, one needs:

- a spack developing environement with Julia and llvm passed as external packages
- An installation of CxxWrap.jl via the Julia package manager

Note: for now, all the CMake paths are hardcoded.

The biggest question at the moment: how to pass MPI comms from Julia to Sirius ?!?
